                    <h3>INSECTS</h3>
                    <p>insect house, is a manmade structure created to provide shelter for 
                        insects. They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending 
                        on the specific purpose or specific insect it is catered to. Most 
                        consist of several different sections that provide insects with 
                        nesting facilities â€“ particularly during winter, offering shelter 
                        or refuge for many types of insects. Their purposes include hosting 
                        pollinators.</p>

                    <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
                    <p>Many insect hotels are used as nest sites by insects including 
                        solitary bees and solitary wasps. These insects drag prey to the nest 
                        where an egg is deposited. Other insects hotels are specifically 
                        designed to allow the insects to hibernate, notable examples include 
                        ladybirds (ladybugs) and, arguably, butterflies.</p>

                    <p>Insect hotels are popular amongst gardeners and fruit and vegetable 
                        growers due to their role encouraging insect pollination. Some 
                        elaborately designed insect hotels may also be attractions in their 
                        own right and, increasingly, can be found in pub gardens and various 
                        tourist locations.</p>

                    <p>The introduction of insect hotels into a habitat provides valuable 
                        housing for beneficial insects. Impacts can be seen in the form of 
                        better soil quality, increased pollination, elevated ecosystem d
                        iversity, and reductions in the populations of detrimental insects.</p>
